# tictactoe-react
A simple react implementation of a tic tac toe game.
This game has been developed on OSX sierra, as a `rack` application for a simple 'static' deployment on Heroku.

## Development
Install ruby (2.4.1 was the stable version at the time of writing):

`rvm install 2.4.1`

Clone the repository, then install the required gems to run the rack application:

`git clone https://github.com/ekynoxe/tictactoe-react.git`

`gem install bundler` (if you don't have it installed yet)

`bundle install`

To run the app:

`rackup`
